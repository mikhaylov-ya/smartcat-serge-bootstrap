definitions:
- description: are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
  name: Arithmetic operations
- description: is an operation with only one operand. For example, `-3` is an unary
    operation to get the number opposite to the number 3.
  name: Unary operation
- description: is an operation involving two operands. For example, `3 + 9`.
  name: Binary operation
instructions: Write a program that calculates and prints the difference between `6`
  and `-81`.
name: Operators
theory: "Before we move on, let's grasp the basic terminology. Operation signs such
  as `+` are called **operators**. They perform operations on certain values (**operands**).
  Operators are usually represented by one or more symbols, less often by a word.
  Most of the operators are identical to those from arithmetics.\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(8
  + 2);\n```\nHere `+` is an addition **operator**,  `8` and `2` are **operands**.
  \n\nAddition operation has two operands, left and right of the operator `+`. Operations
  with two operands are called **binary**. If at least one operand is missing, for
  example, `3 + ;` then the program will throw a syntax error.\n\nBesides binary operations
  (not operators) there are unary operations (with one operand) and even ternary (with
  three operands)! Moreover, operators may look the same but denote different operations.\n\n
  ```javascript\n  console.log(-3); // => -3\n  ```\nIn the example above the unary
  operation applies to `3`. An interpreter reads it as follows: the minus operator
  tells him to take the number `3` and find the opposite, which is `-3`.\n\nYou might
  be a bit confused since `-3` is both a number and an operator with an operand, but
  that's how programming languages work."
